# Watchify!
Is an android application using for digital watches which doesn't support all languages same as Xiaomi MiBands. This application helps to read notifications and Translate input messages or make readable that unsupported languages.

## How does it work:
After installation user needs to give Notification-Access-Reading and after that, adding Auto start enable and not restriction Battery on MiFit Application, he/she should enable App alert on and select just Wathcify application for sending notification to Watch or Band (same as my MiBand 4 - Xiaomi)
Now everytime some application push a notification, Watchity will get that content and translate with Google api translator to destination language(currently: English and Germany) and will push new notification, so we will get new translated message on our accessory like this:
